# Abstract

Oil and gas pipeline failures pose significant risks to human safety, operational reliability, and economic sustainability, highlighting the critical need for accurate pipeline failure risk prediction. Traditional assessment methods, such as semi-empirical models and expert judgment, struggle with scalability and complexity. Machine learning offers a powerful alternative, allowing large-scale data processing, pattern recognition, and improved failure risk prediction. By overcoming traditional limitations, ML supports proactive pipeline management, especially amid aging infrastructure and rising hazards as a consequence. This study develops an ML-based framework for classifying pipeline failure risks into low, medium, and high-risk classes. Models including support vector machine, random forest, artificial neural network, logistic regression, and stacking ensemble were trained on proprietary industry data. Advanced preprocessing, feature engineering, and hyperparameter tuning improved the overall model performances. Testing on Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration data covering 56,402 miles showed the ANN and SVM models performed best with an equal 90% overall accuracy. Through classification metrics, confusion matrix analyses, and feature sensitivity studies, this study highlights key failure factors, including flowline age, operating pressure, and material properties. These findings provide a data-driven approach to risk assessment, helping operators prioritize high-risk pipelines, optimize resource allocation, and improve pipeline safety and sustainability.
