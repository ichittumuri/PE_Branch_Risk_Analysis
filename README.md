The Petroleum Engineering branch focuses on interpreting flowline failures through an engineering lens and translating data-driven results into practical insight for inspection planning, maintenance prioritization, and spill mitigation. While the Applied Mathematics and Statistics branch emphasizes model development and statistical structure, this branch centers on domain-informed analysis of spill records, failure mechanisms, and operational context to ensure that modeling outputs remain physically meaningful and actionable.
